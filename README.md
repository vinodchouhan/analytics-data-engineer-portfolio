📊 End-to-End Data Engineering Pipeline with Databricks

This case study demonstrates the design and implementation of a complete data engineering solution using Azure Databricks and Delta Lake, following modern Lakehouse architecture best practices.

🎯 Objective

Build a robust, scalable pipeline that ingests raw transactional and customer data, applies cleaning and transformation logic, enforces data quality checks, and delivers analytics-ready output for BI consumption.

🔁 Pipeline Overview
graph TD
    A[Raw CSVs (Bronze Layer)] --> B[Data Cleaning & Enrichment (Silver Layer)]
    B --> C[Data Quality Checks]
    C --> D[Business Logic / Aggregation (Gold Layer)]
    D --> E[Delta Table Output for Power BI / Reporting]

🧱 Architecture: Bronze → Silver → Gold (Medallion)

Bronze Layer: Raw ingestion from CSV files
Silver Layer: Cleaned, deduplicated, schema-aligned data
Gold Layer: Business logic applied; aggregated metrics and curated datasets

🛠️ Tools & Technologies	
Component	      Technology
Cloud Platform	Azure
Compute Engine	Azure Databricks
Language	      PySpark (Python)
Storage Format	Delta Lake (Parquet)
DQ Logic	      PySpark filtering
Visualization	  Power BI, Fabric

✅ Features Implemented

Ingested customer and transaction datasets
Removed nulls, handled bad/missing records
Applied transformations: trimming, casting, formatting
Added is_valid_customer_name, transaction_date_valid, etc. fields
Ensured clean, analytics-ready data stored in Delta format
Output ready for Power BI dashboards or reporting

🧪 Sample DQ Checks

Remove rows with null or invalid customer names (non-alphabetic)
Validate date formats (e.g., yyyy-MM-dd)
Deduplicate records based on business keys

📊 Business Use Case Examples

Track daily and monthly transactions by customer
Segment customer behavior by location or transaction value
Build dashboards for finance or customer analytics teams
